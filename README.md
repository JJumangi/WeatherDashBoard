# **Weather Dashboard Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**

For this assignment:

- I was attempting to create a interactive webpage that will allow users to look up the weather forecast for a selected city.
- The forecast includes the date, current weather (image), temperature, windy speed and humidity of the city searched.
- The user's previously searched cities will save to local storage, for users to quicky recall a city and look at it's forecast
